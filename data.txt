Array
Explanation: An array is the simplest data structure that stores elements in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed directly using its index position in constant time. Elements are stored sequentially with a fixed size determined at creation time. The structure provides efficient random access but has limited flexibility for dynamic operations.
Real-life analogy: Think of an array like a row of numbered parking spaces in a parking lot. Each space has a specific number and can hold exactly one car. You can quickly find any car by going directly to its space number. The number of spaces is fixed, so if more cars arrive than spaces available, you cannot fit them in. This is why the size of the array is set when it is created, making it very straightforward but not very flexible.
Algorithms:
• Linear Search
• Binary Search
• Merge Sort
• Quick Sort

Stack
Explanation: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle for element access. Elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack structure. The most recently added element is always the first one to be removed. This restriction makes stacks ideal for managing function calls and expression evaluation.
Real-life analogy: Think of a stack like a pile of books on your desk. You can only add new books to the top of the pile and take books from the top. The book you placed last will be the first one you pick up. You cannot remove a book from the middle without first removing all books above it. This is simple and keeps things organized but restricts how you can access the books.
Algorithms:
• Depth First Search
• Backtracking Algorithm
• Expression Evaluation
• Tower of Hanoi

Queue
Explanation: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle for processing elements. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front of the queue. The first element added is always the first one to be removed from the structure. This ordering makes queues perfect for scheduling and buffering operations.
Real-life analogy: Think of a queue like a line of customers waiting at a bank teller. The first person to join the line gets served first by the teller. New customers join at the back of the line, and customers leave from the front. Everyone is served in the exact order they arrived, making it fair for all. This way, no one can skip ahead, and everyone waits patiently for their turn.
Algorithms:
• Breadth First Search
• Level Order Traversal
• Dijkstra's Algorithm
• Round Robin Scheduling

Linked List
Explanation: A linked list stores elements in nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays do. The list can grow or shrink dynamically during runtime by allocating new nodes. Traversal must be done sequentially from the head node to access any specific element.
Real-life analogy: Think of a linked list like a treasure hunt where each clue leads you to the next location. You start at the first clue and follow the chain of clues sequentially through the hunt. You can add new clues anywhere in the chain or remove them easily during the game. However, you cannot jump directly to the middle clue without following the path from the beginning, making it a step-by-step exploration.
Algorithms:
• Floyd's Cycle Detection
• Merge Two Sorted Lists
• Kadane's Algorithm
• Two Pointer Technique

Doubly Linked List
Explanation: A doubly linked list extends the basic linked list by adding a previous pointer to each node. Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. This bidirectional connectivity allows traversal in both forward and backward directions efficiently. The structure provides more flexibility but requires additional memory for the extra pointer.
Real-life analogy: Think of a doubly linked list like a train where each car is connected to both its front and rear neighbors. You can walk from any car to the front or back of the train in either direction. Each car knows which cars are immediately in front and behind it. This makes it easier to find your way back if you miss your stop or want to go back a few cars without starting from the beginning.

• LRU Cache Algorithm
• Josephus Problem
• Palindrome Check
• Browser History

Circular Queue
Explanation: A circular queue is a variation of the basic queue where the last position connects back to the first position. This circular arrangement eliminates the problem of unused space that occurs in linear queues. The rear pointer wraps around to the beginning when it reaches the maximum capacity. This design provides efficient memory utilization for fixed-size buffer applications.
Real-life analogy: Think of a circular queue like a round dining table where people sit in chairs arranged in a circle. When the last chair is occupied, the next person sits in the first chair if it becomes available. The seating continues in a circular fashion around the table. This arrangement ensures no chair remains permanently unused if people keep leaving and joining.
Algorithms:
• Round Robin Scheduling
• Producer Consumer Problem
• Buffer Management
• Sliding Window

Binary Tree
Explanation: A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children nodes. The topmost node is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaf nodes. Each node contains data and pointers to its left and right subtrees for navigation. The structure naturally represents hierarchical relationships and enables efficient searching and sorting operations.
Real-life analogy: Think of a binary tree like a family genealogy where each person can have at most two children. The oldest ancestor sits at the top as the root of the family tree. The family branches downward with each generation, creating a hierarchical structure. You can trace any family lineage by following the parent-child connections through the generations.
Algorithms:
• Tree Traversal
• Binary Tree Construction
• Lowest Common Ancestor
• Tree Diameter

Binary Search Tree
Explanation: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree with a special ordering property for efficient data retrieval. For every node, all values in the left subtree are smaller than the node's value. All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value throughout the structure. This ordering property enables logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
Real-life analogy: Think of a BST like organizing books in a library using a systematic shelving method. Books with smaller reference numbers go to the left section, and larger numbers go to the right section. To find any book, you start at the main desk and keep going left or right based on comparing reference numbers. This systematic organization makes finding any book much faster than checking every shelf randomly.
Algorithms:
• Binary Search
• In-order Traversal
• Morris Traversal
• Tree Validation

AVL Tree
Explanation: An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree where the height difference between subtrees is strictly controlled. The height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. When this balance condition is violated during insertion or deletion, the tree automatically rebalances itself through rotations. This strict balancing ensures optimal logarithmic performance for all operations consistently.
Real-life analogy: Think of an AVL tree like a perfectly balanced mobile hanging from the ceiling in an art gallery. Each branch point can support decorative elements on both sides, but if one side becomes too heavy, the mobile tips over. To keep it balanced, you need to rearrange the branches through careful rotations so that no side is significantly heavier. This maintains perfect balance and aesthetic stability.
Algorithms:
• Tree Rotation
• Height Balancing
• Self-Balancing Insertion
• Balance Factor

Red-Black Tree
Explanation: A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an additional color attribute. Every node is colored either red or black following specific coloring rules for balance maintenance. The root is always black, and red nodes cannot have red children in the structure. These color constraints ensure that the longest path is no more than twice the shortest path.
Real-life analogy: Think of a Red-Black tree like a traffic management system where intersections are marked with red or black signs. Red intersections indicate caution zones that cannot be adjacent to other red zones for safety. Black intersections are safe zones that can be placed anywhere in the network. This color-coding system ensures smooth traffic flow and prevents dangerous congestion patterns.
Algorithms:
• Red-Black Insertion
• Red-Black Deletion
• Color Fixing
• Tree Recoloring

Heap
Explanation: A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies a specific heap property for efficient priority management. In a max heap, each parent node is greater than or equal to its children nodes. In a min heap, each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children nodes. Heaps are commonly implemented using arrays for efficient memory usage and fast parent-child index calculations.
Real-life analogy: Think of a heap like a corporate hierarchy where the CEO earns more than all managers below. Each manager earns more than their direct reports, maintaining a strict salary ordering throughout the company. Everyone knows their immediate boss and subordinates in the organizational structure. When someone gets promoted or leaves, salaries might need adjustment to maintain the proper hierarchy.
Algorithms:
• Heap Sort
• Dijkstra's Algorithm
• Huffman Coding
• Priority Queue

Hash Table
Explanation: A hash table stores key-value pairs using a hash function to compute array indices efficiently. The hash function converts keys into array positions where corresponding values are stored for retrieval. Collisions occur when different keys map to the same index and require resolution strategies. This structure provides average constant-time access to elements making it extremely efficient for lookups.
Real-life analogy: Think of a hash table like a large library where books are organized using a special numbering system. Each book's title is converted into a specific shelf number using a mathematical formula for placement. You can find any book instantly by calculating its shelf number rather than searching through every shelf. Sometimes two books might end up on the same shelf, requiring additional organization at that specific location.
Algorithms:
• Hashing Algorithm
• Linear Probing
• Quadratic Probing
• Double Hashing

Trie
Explanation: A trie is a tree-like data structure specifically designed for storing and retrieving strings efficiently. Each node represents a character, and paths from root to nodes represent prefixes or complete words. Each node contains an array of pointers to child nodes, typically one for each possible character. Common prefixes are shared among different strings, making it space-efficient for storing large dictionaries.
Real-life analogy: Think of a trie like a word-building game tree where you construct words letter by letter. Starting from a central point, each path represents typing letters in sequence to form meaningful words. Multiple words can share the same beginning letters, so you follow the same path until words diverge. You mark certain points as complete words, like putting a flag when you've spelled something meaningful.
Algorithms:
• Pattern Matching
• Auto-complete
• Spell Checker
• Longest Common Prefix

Graph
Explanation: A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices connected by edges representing relationships. Vertices represent entities or objects, and edges represent connections or relationships between these entities. Graphs can be directed where edges have direction, or undirected where edges are bidirectional. They can also be weighted with edge values or unweighted for simple connectivity representation.
Real-life analogy: Think of a graph like a social media network where people are vertices and friendships are edges. Some friendships might be one-way like following someone who doesn't follow back, representing directed edges. Others are mutual like being friends on Facebook, representing undirected edges. The strength of relationships could be represented by weights on the connections between people.
Algorithms:
• Depth First Search
• Breadth First Search
• Dijkstra's Algorithm
• Kruskal's Algorithm

B-Tree
Explanation: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, and deletions. Each node can contain multiple keys and have more than two children, unlike binary trees. All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring balanced height for consistent performance. B-Trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data efficiently.
Real-life analogy: Think of a B-Tree like a multi-level filing cabinet in a large office building. Each drawer can hold multiple folders, and each folder can point to several sub-drawers below. All the bottom drawers are at the same floor level for easy access. This organization allows office workers to find any document quickly without having to search through too many levels.
Algorithms:
• B-Tree Search
• B-Tree Insertion
• B-Tree Deletion
• B-Tree Splitting

Segment Tree
Explanation: A segment tree is a binary tree used for answering range queries on arrays efficiently. Each node represents a segment or range of the original array with aggregated information. Leaf nodes represent individual array elements, while internal nodes store combined information of their children. The structure allows both range queries and updates to be performed in logarithmic time complexity.
Real-life analogy: Think of a segment tree like a hierarchical sales reporting system in a large retail company. Each store manager reports sales for their individual store, while regional managers combine reports from multiple stores. District managers aggregate regional reports, and so on up to the CEO who sees total company sales. When any store updates its sales, the changes propagate up through all management levels.

• Range Minimum Query
• Range Sum Query
• Lazy Propagation
• Point Update
