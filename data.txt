What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a powerful, open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. At its core, TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. The key value proposition of TypeScript is its optional static typing. Unlike JavaScript, where a variable's type is only checked at runtime, TypeScript allows you to define the types of your variables, function parameters, and return values before your code ever runs.

The TypeScript code you write is not executed directly. Instead, it is processed by the TypeScript compiler (tsc), which "transpiles" the code into plain JavaScript. This resulting JavaScript code can then be run in any environment that supports JavaScript, whether it's a web browser, a Node.js server, or a mobile application. This process allows developers to use modern language features and a robust type system while still maintaining compatibility with the vast JavaScript ecosystem.

The core benefit of this approach is the ability to catch a wide range of common programming errors during development, rather than at runtime when they can cause application crashes or unexpected behavior. The compiler's type-checking process acts as a powerful safety net, providing a more predictable and reliable coding experience.

Why should I use TypeScript instead of JavaScript?
The decision to use TypeScript is often driven by the need for increased reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity, especially in large-scale projects. While JavaScript is flexible and easy to start with, its dynamic nature can become a liability as a codebase grows. TypeScript addresses these issues with several key benefits:

Early Error Detection: The most significant advantage is its ability to catch type-related bugs at compile time. Typos, incorrect function arguments, or attempting to access a property that doesn't exist on an object are all caught by the TypeScript compiler. This prevents a whole class of runtime errors that can be difficult to debug in a pure JavaScript environment.

Improved Developer Experience: The static type information allows modern code editors and IDEs (like VS Code) to provide powerful features that are not possible with plain JavaScript. This includes intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), real-time syntax checking, and sophisticated refactoring tools. Your editor can understand the shape of your data and suggest available methods and properties, leading to faster development and fewer mistakes.

Enhanced Code Readability and Maintainability: TypeScript acts as a form of self-documentation. By defining types, you explicitly declare the expected data structures, function inputs, and outputs. This makes the code easier for new team members to understand and for existing team members to maintain. The type definitions clarify the intent of the code, reducing the need for extensive comments.

Better Team Collaboration: In a team environment, having a common contract for data and functions (enforced by types) helps prevent miscommunication and errors between different parts of the codebase. When one developer changes a function's signature, the compiler will immediately notify any other developers who are using that function and need to update their code.

Robust Refactoring: When you refactor code in a large JavaScript project, it's often a manual and error-prone process. With TypeScript, a good IDE can automatically update type references and function calls throughout the codebase, providing a high degree of confidence that your changes haven't broken anything.

What are the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?
The fundamental difference lies in the static type system. JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. TypeScript is statically typed, with types checked at compile time. This core difference enables a host of additional features that TypeScript adds to the language:

Interfaces: A powerful feature for defining the shape of objects. Interfaces are purely a compile-time construct that ensure objects adhere to a specific contract.

Enums (Enumerations): A way to define a set of named constants, making code more readable and less prone to errors than using "magic strings" or numbers.

Generics: Allow you to write flexible, reusable components that work with a variety of types while still maintaining type safety.

Access Modifiers (public, private, protected): These keywords allow you to control the visibility and accessibility of class members, promoting better object-oriented design and encapsulation.

Decorators: A syntax for adding metadata and behavior to class declarations and their members. Commonly used in frameworks like Angular and NestJS.

Type Aliases: A simple way to give a name to a specific type, such as a union type or a tuple.

Advanced TypeScript Concepts
What is the any type and why should I avoid it?
The any type is a special escape hatch in TypeScript. When a variable is declared with the any type, TypeScript effectively turns off all type-checking for that variable. This means you can assign it any value and perform any operation on it without the compiler raising an error.

Example:

let myVariable: any = 10;
myVariable = "hello"; // No error
myVariable = { name: "Alice" }; // No error

let result = myVariable.toUpperCase(); // No error at compile time
// This will throw a runtime error if myVariable is a number or object.

While any can be useful in specific situations, such as when migrating a legacy JavaScript project or dealing with third-party libraries that lack type definitions, its overuse completely defeats the purpose of using TypeScript. It reintroduces the very runtime errors that TypeScript is designed to prevent. Instead, it's a best practice to use the more type-safe alternative, unknown.

What is the difference between an interface and a type alias?
This is a common point of confusion, as interface and type can often be used for the same purpose: defining the shape of an object. However, there are a few key differences that determine which one you should use.

Interface:

Declaration Merging: Interfaces can be re-declared in the same scope, and TypeScript will automatically merge their definitions. This is a powerful feature for library authors who want to extend an existing type.

interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  age: number;
}

// The Person interface now has both 'name' and 'age' properties.
const user: Person = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };

Primarily for Object Shapes: Interfaces are best suited for defining the shape of objects, classes, and function signatures.

Type Alias:

Cannot be Re-declared: A type alias cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

type ID = string;
// type ID = number; // Error: Duplicate identifier 'ID'.

More Versatile: type aliases can be used for more than just object shapes. They are essential for defining:

Union Types: type Status = "pending" | "completed" | "failed";

Intersection Types: type Admin = Person & Employee;

Tuple Types: type Coords = [number, number];

Function Signatures: type Greeter = (name: string) => string;

Best Practice: A good rule of thumb is to prefer interface for object and class shapes due to its declaration merging capabilities. Use type for everything else, such as union types, intersections, or giving a name to a primitive type.

What are union and intersection types?
These two features are fundamental for creating complex and flexible types.

Union Types
A union type allows a variable to be one of several different types. It is represented by a pipe (|) character. This is incredibly useful for functions that can accept multiple types of arguments or variables whose value might not be of a single type.

Example:

// A variable can be a string or a number
let id: string | number;

id = 123;
console.log(id); // 123

id = "abc";
console.log(id); // "abc"

// This function can accept a string or a number
function printID(id: string | number) {
  // We can use type narrowing to handle each case
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    console.log(id.toUpperCase()); // Safe to use string methods
  } else {
    console.log(id.toFixed(2)); // Safe to use number methods
  }
}

Intersection Types
An intersection type combines multiple types into a single new type. It is represented by an ampersand (&) character. The new type has all the properties of all the types that were combined.

Example:

interface HasName {
  name: string;
}

interface HasAge {
  age: number;
}

// A new type that has both 'name' and 'age'
type Person = HasName & HasAge;

const user: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

This is useful for creating new, more specific types by combining existing ones, without needing to redefine them.

Type Inference and Narrowing
What is type inference and how does it work?
Type inference is one of TypeScript's most powerful features. It allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable, function return, or expression without you having to explicitly annotate it. This keeps your code clean and concise while still providing the benefits of type safety.

The compiler uses a few key pieces of information to infer types:

Initialization: If you initialize a variable with a value, TypeScript will use that value's type.

let myName = "John"; // Inferred as `string`
let age = 30; // Inferred as `number`
let isActive = true; // Inferred as `boolean`

Function Return Values: The compiler can infer a function's return type based on what it returns.

function getMessage() {
  return "Hello, world!";
}
// Inferred return type is `string`

Contextual Typing: TypeScript can infer types based on the context in which a variable or function is used.

const names = ["Alice", "Bob"];
names.forEach((name) => {
  // The type of `name` is inferred as `string` because it's an element of a string array.
  console.log(name.toUpperCase());
});

What is type-narrowing and how does it work?
Type-narrowing is the process by which TypeScript's compiler refines a variable's type from a broad type to a more specific one. This is done through runtime checks that the compiler can use to understand the variable's type within a specific code block. This allows you to safely use methods and properties that are only available on the narrowed type.

Common narrowing techniques include:

typeof check: Useful for primitive types (string, number, boolean, symbol).

function logValue(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    // `value` is now narrowed to type `string`
    console.log(value.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // `value` is now narrowed to type `number`
    console.log(value.toFixed(2));
  }
}

instanceof check: Useful for classes.

class Cat {
  meow() { console.log("meow!"); }
}
class Dog {
  bark() { console.log("woof!"); }
}

function makeAnimalSound(animal: Cat | Dog) {
  if (animal instanceof Cat) {
    animal.meow(); // Safely call `meow()`
  } else {
    animal.bark(); // Safely call `bark()`
  }
}

in operator: Useful for checking if a property exists on an object.

interface Cat { meow: () => void; }
interface Dog { bark: () => void; }

function makeAnimalSound(animal: Cat | Dog) {
  if ("meow" in animal) {
    animal.meow(); // Safely call `meow()`
  } else {
    animal.bark(); // Safely call `bark()`
  }
}

Custom type guards: You can create your own functions to narrow types using a special return type called a type predicate.

interface Bird { fly(): void; }
interface Fish { swim(): void; }

function isBird(animal: Bird | Fish): animal is Bird {
  return (animal as Bird).fly !== undefined;
}

function move(animal: Bird | Fish) {
  if (isBird(animal)) {
    animal.fly(); // `animal` is now narrowed to type `Bird`
  } else {
    animal.swim();
  }
}

Other Key TypeScript Features
What is a tuple in TypeScript?
A tuple is a special type of array where the number of elements is fixed, and the type of each element at a specific index is known. It allows you to express an array with a very specific, ordered structure.

Example:

// A tuple where the first element is a string and the second is a number
let user: [string, number];

user = ["Alice", 25]; // Correct
// user = [25, "Alice"]; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
// user = ["Alice", 25, true]; // Error: Source has 3 elements, but target has 2

Tuples are great for representing a fixed-size record, like a pair of coordinates [number, number], a key-value pair [string, string], or a [success, data] result from an API.

What are enums?
Enums (short for enumerations) allow you to define a set of named constants. They make your code more readable and prevent errors caused by typos in strings or numbers.

Numeric Enums:
By default, enums are numeric, starting at 0.

enum Direction {
  Up,    // 0
  Down,  // 1
  Left,  // 2
  Right  // 3
}
let playerDirection = Direction.Up;
console.log(playerDirection); // 0

You can also manually set the initial value.

enum StatusCode {
  NotFound = 404,
  Success = 200,
  ServerError = 500
}

String Enums:
String enums are often more readable and debug-friendly.

enum UserStatus {
  Active = "ACTIVE",
  Inactive = "INACTIVE",
  Pending = "PENDING"
}
let currentUserStatus = UserStatus.Active;
console.log(currentUserStatus); // "ACTIVE"

Best Practice: While enums are useful, a modern alternative is to use a string literal union type, which offers similar benefits with a simpler syntax.

type UserStatusLiteral = "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE" | "PENDING";
let status: UserStatusLiteral = "ACTIVE";

What are generics and why are they important?
Generics are a cornerstone of modern, type-safe programming. They allow you to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types, rather than being limited to a single one. Generics use a "type variable," typically represented by <T>, as a placeholder for a type that will be provided when the component is used.

Example: A Generic Function
A function that returns the first element of an array. Without generics, you would lose type information.

function getFirstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0];
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const firstNum = getFirstElement(numbers); // `firstNum` is inferred as `number`
console.log(firstNum); // 1

const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
const firstName = getFirstElement(names); // `firstName` is inferred as `string`
console.log(firstName); // "Alice"

Example: A Generic Interface

interface ApiResponse<T> {
  status: number;
  message: string;
  data: T; // The type of `data` is determined by the generic type `T`
}

// A specific API response for a list of users
const usersResponse: ApiResponse<{ name: string; id: number }[]> = {
  status: 200,
  message: "Users fetched successfully",
  data: [{ name: "Zack", id: 101 }],
};

Generics are essential for building flexible and type-safe data structures like Array<T>, Promise<T>, and Map<K, V>.

The TypeScript Configuration File
What is the tsconfig.json file?
The tsconfig.json file is the central configuration file for any TypeScript project. It tells the TypeScript compiler (tsc) how to compile your code, which files to include, and which compiler options to use. A well-configured tsconfig.json is crucial for a smooth development experience.

Key options you will commonly find:

target: Specifies the ECMAScript version to which the code will be compiled (e.g., "ES2020" for modern environments).

module: Specifies the module system to use (e.g., "commonjs" for Node.js, "esnext" for modern browsers).

outDir: The directory where the compiled JavaScript files will be placed.

rootDir: The root directory of your source files.

strict: A master switch that enables a suite of stricter type-checking options, which is a best practice for all new projects.

lib: Specifies which built-in library definitions to include (e.g., "dom" for browser APIs, "es2020" for modern features).

include and exclude: Used to specify which files and directories should be included or excluded from the compilation process.

What is strict mode in tsconfig.json and why should I use it?
Enabling the strict flag in tsconfig.json is a best practice. It is not a single option but rather a shorthand for enabling several important, stricter type-checking flags at once. This significantly improves code quality and helps you catch a wider range of potential bugs.

Flags enabled by strict:

noImplicitAny: Prevents variables from implicitly having the any type.

strictNullChecks: This is arguably the most important of the strict flags. It prevents null and undefined from being assigned to variables unless you explicitly declare them as optional. This eliminates a huge class of common runtime errors.

strictFunctionTypes: Ensures function parameters are checked more strictly.

strictBindCallApply: Ensures that the bind, call, and apply methods are checked more strictly.

strictPropertyInitialization: Requires that all class properties are initialized in the constructor.

By using strict mode, you are telling the compiler to be more aggressive in its type-checking, resulting in more robust and reliable code.

Object-Oriented Concepts and Decorators
What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly with the new keyword. It is designed to serve as a base class that other classes can inherit from. Abstract classes can contain both concrete methods (with an implementation) and abstract methods, which have no implementation and must be provided by any class that inherits from the abstract class.

Example:

abstract class Animal {
  // Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
  abstract makeSound(): void;
  
  // Concrete method with an implementation
  eat(): void {
    console.log("The animal is eating.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  // We must implement the abstract method
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

// const myAnimal = new Animal(); // Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
const myDog = new Dog();
myDog.makeSound(); // Woof!
myDog.eat(); // The animal is eating.

Abstract classes are ideal for defining a common blueprint or contract for a group of related classes.

What is a decorator?
A decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators are functions that are executed at compile time and can add new functionality or metadata to the code they are attached to. They are a form of meta-programming, allowing you to modify classes and members without changing their underlying code.

Example: A Simple Decorator

// A decorator function that logs a message
function logClass(target: any) {
  console.log(`The class name is: ${target.name}`);
}

// Apply the decorator to a class
@logClass
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    console.log("MyClass instance created");
  }
}

Decorators are still an experimental feature in TypeScript but are widely used in frameworks like Angular and NestJS for dependency injection, routing, and more.

What is a type assertion?
A type assertion is a way for you, the developer, to tell the TypeScript compiler that you know more about the type of a value than it can infer on its own. It's a way of overriding the compiler's type-checking, similar to type-casting in other languages, but it has no runtime effect on your code.

There are two main syntaxes for type assertions:

The as syntax (preferred):

const someValue: any = "this is a string";
const strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

The angle-bracket syntax (not compatible with JSX):

const someValue: any = "this is a string";
const strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;

You should use type assertions with caution, as they disable the compiler's type-checking for that specific line. They are best used when you are certain about a value's type, but the compiler can't figure it out.

What are utility types?
Utility types are a set of built-in types in TypeScript that provide a powerful way to transform or manipulate existing types. They save you from writing boilerplate code and make your types more expressive.

Some of the most common utility types include:

Partial<T>: Makes all properties of a type T optional.

interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

// `PartialTodo` has optional `title` and `description` properties
type PartialTodo = Partial<Todo>;
// { title?: string; description?: string; }

Readonly<T>: Makes all properties of a type T read-only.

type ReadonlyTodo = Readonly<Todo>;
// { readonly title: string; readonly description: string; }

Pick<T, K>: Creates a new type by picking a set of properties K from a type T.

type TodoTitle = Pick<Todo, "title">;
// { title: string; }

Omit<T, K>: Creates a new type by omitting a set of properties K from a type T.

type TodoWithoutDescription = Omit<Todo, "description">;
// { title: string; }

Exclude<T, U>: Constructs a type by excluding from T all properties that are assignable to U.

ReturnType<T>: Extracts the return type of a function type T.

What is the never type?
The never type represents the type of values that will never occur. It is most commonly used as a function's return type when the function is guaranteed to never return a value. This can happen in two scenarios:

A function that throws an error:

function error(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

A function with an infinite loop:

function loopForever(): never {
  while (true) { }
}

The never type is a subtype of every other type. This makes it a powerful tool for type-narrowing and ensuring that all possible cases in a switch statement or an if/else chain are handled.

Advanced Type Operators
What is the keyof type operator?
The keyof operator takes an object type and produces a union of its properties' keys.
Example:

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
type UserKeys = keyof User; // Type is 'id' | 'name' | 'age'

The keyof operator is incredibly useful when combined with generics to create type-safe functions that can access a property on any object.

function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
  return obj[key];
}

const user = { id: 1, name: "Bob" };
const userName = getProperty(user, "name"); // `userName` is inferred as `string`
// const userAge = getProperty(user, "age"); // Error: 'age' does not exist on type '{ id: number; name: string; }'

What is a mapped type?
A mapped type allows you to create a new type based on an existing type by iterating through its properties and applying a transformation. This is done using a syntax similar to a for...in loop.
Example: A Mutable mapped type

interface ReadonlyUser {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly age: number;
}

// A mapped type that removes the `readonly` modifier
type Mutable<T> = {
  -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

type MyMutableUser = Mutable<ReadonlyUser>;
// { name: string; age: number; }

Mapped types are the foundation for many of TypeScript's built-in utility types, like Partial<T> and Readonly<T>.

What is a conditional type?
A conditional type allows you to define a type that depends on a condition. They are written in a form that resembles a ternary operator: SomeType extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType. This provides a way to create highly dynamic and flexible types.
Example:

type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type a = IsString<"hello">; // Type is "Yes"
type b = IsString<123>;      // Type is "No"

Conditional types are essential for creating advanced utility types and for making your type system more expressive.

Handling External Code
How do I handle third-party JavaScript libraries in TypeScript?
When you use a third-party JavaScript library in a TypeScript project, the TypeScript compiler needs a way to understand the library's structure. It does this through a type definition file, which has a .d.ts extension. These files contain only type declarations and no executable code.

Most popular libraries have community-maintained type definitions available on DefinitelyTyped, a public repository of high-quality type definitions. You can install these using npm with the @types/ prefix.

Example:
To get type definitions for the popular library lodash, you would run:

npm install @types/lodash --save-dev

If a library does not have type definitions, you can create a simple one yourself in a .d.ts file, or as a last resort, declare the module as having the any type to temporarily disable type-checking for that module.

What is a declaration file?
A declaration file, ending in .d.ts, is a file that contains only type information. It is the bridge between the type-free world of JavaScript and the type-safe world of TypeScript. You can either write these files yourself to describe your own JavaScript code or use the ones provided by the @types/ packages.

Example: A simple logger.d.ts file

// logger.d.ts
declare module "my-logger" {
  export function log(message: string): void;
  export function error(message: string): void;
}

This file tells the TypeScript compiler that there is a module named "my-logger" that exports two functions, log and error, both of which take a string and return void.

The readonly Modifier and Optional Properties
What is a readonly modifier?
The readonly modifier can be applied to a property of a class or an interface to make it immutable. Once a readonly property is initialized (either at declaration or in the constructor), its value cannot be changed. This is a powerful way to enforce immutability and prevent accidental modification of important data.

Example:

interface User {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;
}

const user: User = { id: 123, name: "Jane" };
// user.id = 456; // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
user.name = "John"; // This is allowed

How do you handle optional properties in an interface?
You can mark a property as optional in an interface by adding a question mark (?) after the property name. This tells the compiler that the property might not exist on the object, and you'll need to check for its existence before you use it.

Example:

interface UserProfile {
  name: string;
  email?: string; // Optional property
}

const user1: UserProfile = { name: "Alice" }; // Valid
const user2: UserProfile = { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }; // Also valid

function getUserEmail(user: UserProfile) {
  // We must check if `email` exists before using it
  if (user.email) {
    console.log(`User email: ${user.email}`);
  } else {
    console.log("No email provided.");
  }
}

This is a very common pattern for working with APIs where data might be missing or incomplete.
